The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the Scarletts Gesundheitstracking application. Initial efforts fixed notification issues, especially on HyperOS devices, by refactoring triggers and adding device-specific logic. The Gugi AI chat was refined, moving its LLM integration from a problematic FastAPI backend to a direct frontend OpenAI API call using . Later, due to user request and issues, the AI was re-integrated via the existing backend's  route, utilizing the Universal Key. Build failures, caused by HTML entities in JSX, were identified and corrected. New features include a comprehensive Target Weight goal tracking system with charts and KPIs, a complete overhaul of the Weekly Events progress calculation to prevent false 100% displays, and the integration of dynamic, AI-powered motivation texts on the dashboard. Extensive UI adjustments, such as icon changes, quick access reordering, and the addition of numerous info fields, were also implemented. The latest iteration involves confirming final details for a weekly goal reminder before pushing the updated version 1.2.24.

<product_requirements>
The Scarletts Gesundheitstracking application is an offline-first, multi-language (DE/EN/PL) mobile health tracker. It features a dashboard with daily navigation, XP/Level, modules for Pills, Drinks & Sport, Weight & Goals, and highly customizable reminders. Gamification includes achievements, leveling, and weekly events. A Gugi AI chat provides health assistance, saved messages, and advanced AI insights. An offline leaderboard and comprehensive settings are also included. Recent development aimed at fixing UI/UX issues, refining Gugi AI from a hybrid system (Cloud LLM GPT-4o-mini via FastAPI, then direct frontend, now re-routed through backend proxy) to integrate more robustly with data-driven tips. Other requirements involved editable saved messages, user interaction timestamping, Pro+ and Pro++ heuristics, reliable time-based notifications (cycle/ovulation), refined gamification (Weekly Events logic), and correct Pills section display/XP. Current work focused on addressing HyperOS notification issues, refining chat functionalities (removing local AI, implementing online AI via backend), correcting Weekly Event progress, removing battery optimization warnings, and adding a detailed Target Weight feature.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer has completed a significant set of features and fixes, updating the application to version 1.2.24. The core of the recent work involved fully integrating the Gugi AI through the existing FastAPI backend, utilizing the . This involved updating  to make calls to  and removing all previous local and direct cloud AI implementations (e.g., , ). The  file was updated with the provided .

A major enhancement is the new Target Weight feature, implemented in . This screen allows users to set a  and , storing these along with  and  in . It displays key performance indicators like progress percentage, daily required weight loss, and a pace indicator (ahead/on/behind plan). A mini-chart visualizes actual versus planned weight from the start date to the target date, supporting horizontal scrolling and marking the current day. This screen is accessible via a new Zielgewicht button in the weight card on .

The calculation logic for Weekly Events in  has been completely re-worked to prevent it from showing 100% prematurely, ensuring accurate progress tracking based on specific, positive goals (e.g., water intake based on daily needs, sport activities).

Furthermore, dynamic, AI-generated motivation texts are now displayed directly within the Weekly Event card on the dashboard, powered by the online AI, designed to fit without scrolling. A new utility  has been implemented to schedule weekly goal-specific reminders.

UI/UX improvements include:
-   Removal of the battery optimization warning card from .
-   Re-adding toggles for WÃ¶chentliche Events and KI Insights to the settings screen.
-   Removal of the notification test button from settings.
-   Changing the Pills icon in the dashboard quick access.
-   Reordering quick access icons on the dashboard to: Chat, Gespeichert, FAQ, Einstellungen.
-   Addition of info icons with contextual explanations to various dashboard sections (e.g., Pills, Weekly Event).

All these changes are currently staged, awaiting final confirmation on the goal reminder time before being pushed to the specified GitHub repository.
